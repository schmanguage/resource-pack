# Schmanguage

Schmanguage is a **Minecraft - Java Edition** resource pack which adds a new Language to the languages selection.

---

In this language almost all words start with a "schm" prefix and replace all consonants until, but not including, the first vowal.
Example:
 - ~~L~~<u>a</u>nguage → **Schm**<u>a</u>nguage
 - ~~R~~<u>e</u>source pack → **Schm**<u>e</u>source pack

It is based of the the default language "English - United States" (`en_us`).

## Download

The pack can be downloaded in the [releases](../../releases) page.
